# Database

I've exported the tables, functions, and the procedure of the database I created locally for this test. It is all on plain text ready to just execute through psql or the query tool of pgadmin.

We also need to update the connection string which is located in the file `Program.cs` of the project `Smartwyre.DeveloperTest.Runner`.

Filename: `smartwyre_rebate_db.sql`
